 TinifyAPI program to share

 Executable (.exe) runs a small dashboard with the following buttons:
 -> RUN
 -> RUN MANUAL
 -> SETUP
 -> QUIT
 Status bar at the bottom

 The program is initially 'Paused' (as indicated in the status bar)
 On your first run, click 'SETUP' to:
 1. Add your API Key
 2. Test your API Key
 3. Add/Remove folders to be monitored
 4. Adjust settings as necessary
 5. 'APPLY CHANGES' takes you back to the main window

 Anytime you go to SETUP, the main program loop gets paused.  You will need to hit 'RUN' to resume.

 'RUN MANUAL' will launch a Folder selection popup.
 - Upon picking your folder, the program will loop through all applicable files inside that folder (no recursion/subfolders)
